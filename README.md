## This is a test Next.js/React.js project to showcase and record whatever I am learning from Harkirat's 0-100 cohort

1. `children` is a special variable that lets you access the children inside a component.
2. if you create custom hooks like
   `useTodo` or `useSomeName` then they will behave like hooks only and work inside a React component which needs to have the first letter capital(I mean the function name of the React Component), that's how a react component is identified by libraries.
